Plus:
Great example of multi-modal AI
Good demonstration of applying theory and practice learned in class
Learning from failure, demonstrate effective optimization of modelThorough model selection process
Homebrew model outperformed pre-trained models
Went above and beyondFor the pretrained model, one may want to also investigate fine tuning them, at least the upper convolutional networks, to better handle your downstream medical task.
